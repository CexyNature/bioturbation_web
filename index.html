The reason for this repository

I want to use a transparent, reproducible and open approach in my research projects. The first step which I have employed is to make the data and code associated to my investigation available. In this blog, I am implementing a second level of transparency, this is, sharing preliminary ideas, analysis and results as public posts.

This strategy could serve two purposes: (1) increase/improve/enhance accountability in the research workflow, and (2) improve the way science is communicated using a more organic format which allows to combine text, code and figures.

This is a trial. I do not guarantee follow ups.

# Bioturbation and biodeposition by intertidal crabs

In this blog I share preliminary ideas and results regarding my research about the functional role of intertidal crabs. Posts are predominantly related to bioturbation and biodeposition functions. This is, disturbance and desposition of sediments by biogenic processes, respectively.

I use structure from motion to create 3D models from the sediment and assess changes due to crab activity.

I have also used other techniques to study intertidal crabs. A manuscript about these techniques is currently under revision in a peer review journal. You can consult the bioRxiv preprint [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.11.085803v1.full)
